# Git: The Basics

Welcome to git!
In this section, you will learn how to use git to save and recover your progress on your project,
as well as how to share your work online so others can access it.

If you haven't already done so, you will need to download and install git.
Click [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win) to download git for Windows,
or [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) to download git for macOS.

You are also welcome to download one of the many [graphical git clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).
These GUI clients can be very helpful if you're not used to using the command line,
and most of the commands you will see should translate very smoothly for whichever UI you choose.
For the scope of this guide, however, we will be relying solely on the git command line interface.

## Introducing Yourself to Git

Before you can start using Git, you need to tell it a few things about yourself.
Specifically, git needs to know your name, your email address, and your favorite text editor.
You can use the `git config` command to tell git about each of these things.

In the snippet above, you can see how I would configure git for myself (Buckley Ross).
Obviously, you should change the name and email to your own, since you are not me.
Note that you only need to do this once;
once you set these configuration settings with the `--global` option,
git will remember them for all of your future projects.

It's important to note that I set "core.editor" to 'nvim'
because I prefer to use [NeoVim](https://neovim.io) as my text editor (as you will see later on).
If you aren't familiar with NeoVim, you might want to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) instead.
Once you've installed VS Code, just run `git config --global core.editor 'code'` to inform Git of your decision.
On Windows, you could even choose to use `notepad.exe` to edit files
by running `git config --global core.editor 'C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe'`.
It's up to you to choose a text editor that you're comfortable with,
but don't worry too much about it, since you can always change your mind later.

## Your First Project

Now that we've personalized Git a little bit, let's try it out by creating a new project:

![Running Git Init](../FILES/versioncontrol/gitInit.svg)

You can see in the above snippet that we created a new folder called *myProject*,
which is going to contain all of our code.
We then ran the `git init` command, which created a little folder called *.git*.
This *.git* folder is where git is going to store all of the data about your project,
including all of your backups, and all of the different versions of the code you'll create later on.

### Let's Add Some Content

Git works well with pretty much any kind of data that can be stored in a text file.
We're going to be using Python in this example because it's pretty easy to read,
but it's important to note that git doesn't care at all about your choice of programming language.

Let's create a new file inside our *myProject* folder, and call it *first.py*:
```python
def main():
	print('Hello, git!')

main()
```

This is a pretty good start to our project!
Once you've laid out the main file and entrypoint of your program like we have here (even if it doesn't do very much yet)
that means that it's time to make your first backup, or "commit" as git calls them.

### Checking in with Git

Before we can backup our project, we need to make sure that git knows which files we need it to backup,
and which ones it should leave alone.
To see what git is going to backup, we need to run the `git status` command.
The `git status` command asks git to summarize everything that's currently going on in our project,
as well as what needs to be done before we can make a new backup.
Whenever you're feeling unsure about exactly what's going on in your project,
always make sure to run `git status` to help you figure that out:

![Git Status](../FILES/versioncontrol/gitStatus.svg)

As you can see, git has found our *first.py* file, and has listed it as "Untracked",
which means that git isn't planning on backing up *first.py* because we haven't told git what to do with it yet.
This is a problem for us because we do want git to backup that file.
We can use the `git add <files>` command to tell git which files we want it to backup.
To add our *first.py* file, just run `git add first.py`.
Once you've added *first.py*, go ahead and run `git status` again to see what git thinks about that file now that we've added it.

![Git Add](../FILES/versioncontrol/gitAdd.svg)

Note that our *first.py* file has been moved out of the "Untracked" section,
and is now in the "Changes to be committed" section.
This signifies that our file has been "staged", meaning that git has made a copy of it,
and is waiting for us to instruct it to save that copy as a proper backup.
