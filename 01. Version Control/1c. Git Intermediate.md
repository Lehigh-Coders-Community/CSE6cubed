# Git: Intermediate

Welcome back!
Last time, we learned how to use git to commit (or backup) our code incrementally,
as well as how to navigate forward and backward through our git timeline in order to retrieve information from those commits.
In this article, we're going to learn how to move sideways through time, or to put it more simply,
how to develop multiple different versions of our project in parallel.
The main reason it is useful to do this is so that you and your teammates can each work on different parts of your program at the same time,
without needing to worry too much about what everyone else is doing.

## Sharing your Code Online

The first step to working on a team project is to decide how you're going to share your code with each other.
There are lots of great websites out there designed to help you do just that,
including [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [GitLab](https://bitbucket.org/),
or you could even make your own website with [GitWeb](https://git-scm.com/book/pl/v2/Git-on-the-Server-GitWeb),
but the most popular choice today is [GitHub](https://github.com/).
We'll use GitHub for the scope of this guide, but everything we're going to cover here can be applies to all of the alternatives listed above.

To start things off, you're going to need to create an account on GitHub. Follow [this link](https://github.com/join) to create your account.
Once you've created your account, you can click the "new repository" button
(or just follow [this link](https://github.com/new)) to create a new project on GitHub.
You're going to have to include some basic info here, like the name of your project, and an optional description.
You can put whatever you want here, but I'm going to call mine *git-demo*:

After you click the big green "Create repository" button, GitHub will create a new repository
where you and your teammates can work together on your project:

### Downloading our Repository

Great! We now have an online repository to store all of the code for our project.
Let's get things started by downloading it so we can use it on our local computer.
In order to do this we first need to copy the link under the "Quick setup" section on our project's GitHub page.
My link is "https://github.com/buck-ross/git-demo.git", but yours will be something different,
depending on your username and the name you chose for your project.

Once we have the link copied, we can pass it as an argument to `git clone`.
`git clone` is kind of like `git init` from last chapter, except instead of creating a new project,
it let's us download an existing one from the internet:

### Uploading our Repository

This is nice, but the project's repository is still totally empty.
Let's fix this by uploading our project code from the last guide.
In order to tell git where to upload our code, we need to create a new "remote".
A "remote" is just a URL that git associates with a name, so that it can remember where you like to share the code for your project.
When you `git clone` a repository, git automatically creates a new remote called "origin",
and associates it with the repository you cloned from.

We can replicate this "origin" remote for our other project's folder by running `git remote add origin`, and giving it the URL for our repository:

![Git Remote](../FILES/versioncontrol/gitRemote.svg)

Once we have setup the new remote, we can now upload our code to the repository on GitHub.
To do this, git provides the `git push` command, which we can use like so:

![Git Push](../FILES/versioncontrol/gitPush.svg)

Note that `git push` might prompt you for some login info here.
That's pretty normal.
Just type in your GitHub username & password, hit *[ENTER]*, and you should be good to go.

Although you can normally just run `git push` by itself, without any arguments, and it will just handle the upload for you,
we had to add the `--set-upstream origin master` this time because "master" is a new branch we created in the last guide
when we made our first commit, and GitHub doesn't know about "master" yet, so we use this flag to tell GitHub about our new branch.

You can also see that the `git status` line we ran provided an extra line of output, saying "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'".
This means that our upload was successful, and that the latest copy of our code has now been uploaded to GitHub!
Let's go back to our repository's page on GitHub, and refresh the page to see if it updated.

![Project Code on GitHub](../FILES/versioncontrol/GitHubProject.png)

Excellent! It looks like everything from both our *README.md* and *first.py* files made it to GitHub!
Now all of your friends/teammates can download your code by running `git clone`, just like we did earlier.

Speaking of `git clone`, let's go back over to the other copy of our project that we cloned earlier in this guide.

![Git Log](../FILES/versioncontrol/gitLog3.svg)

Now that we're back, it looks like none of the changes we uploaded earlier got transferred over to our cloned copy.
This is because, although we succeeded in uploading our project to GitHub, this copy of the project was cloned before we did that,
so the copy we cloned was not up to date with the copy we later pushed.
