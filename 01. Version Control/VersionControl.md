# Introducing Git

Imagine spending days or weeks writing a program, almost getting to the point where everything works just right,
and then suddenly everything just breaks, and you can't figure out why.
You waste hours and hours just trying to get back to where you were,
but nothing you do seems to fix the problem.
Maybe you don't have to imagine. Maybe you've been there. I certainly have.

### Version Control

A version control system is defined as a set of programs which solve this problem introduced above.
Version control systems keep track of the history of your project.
They let you save your progress, so that when you inevitably screw up (just like everyone does now and then),
getting back to where you were is just 1 command away!

### So what is "Git"?

Git is a version control system.
There are lots of others, but git is by far the most widely used and supported of them all.
Following this guide, you'll learn how to use git to better manage all of your software projects.
