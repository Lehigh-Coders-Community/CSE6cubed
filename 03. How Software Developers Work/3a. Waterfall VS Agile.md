## Waterfall vs Agile

Waterfall and Agile are considered the two largest "branches" of development methodologies. Waterfall is a linear approach to project management, while Agile is designed to be an interative process. Generally, Agile is the standard in most companies nowadays, but it's still important to know why Waterfall was used and why Agile developed as a counter balance against it. 

### Waterfall

Waterfall is the "old" methodology, and was generally used in large software companies. It tended to be a natural evolution from engineering project management, with generally well-defined products with well-defined use cases (building design never had to change last minute like software does). The development cycle in general was slower, as things like Google and StackOverflow didn't exist when the first large-scale software products got created. Large software products took years to develop, as the tools weren't always there.

##### Waterfall tends to work best when:
- The product doesn't change much from year to year
- Very defined product (customer need is well known)

##### Where Waterfall Falters
- Slow to adapt to changing customer needs
- Software industry changes faster than anything traditional engineering had seen
- Software has a lot of different ways to solve some problems, and the customer isn't always sure what they wanted
- Customer would only see a working product near the end, this led to some problems

### Agile

For these reasons, a new form of software development came into existence - [Agile methodology](https://agilemanifesto.org/), which is designed around the principle of having miniature development cycles throughout the project (typically called Sprints). The focus on continuous value delivery meant it was more likely to keep the project on track, and avoid a delivery-day disaster.

#### Agile tends to work best when:
- Ill-defined product and customer needs (won't know what works until you build some of it)
- You need some partial product out there, and are able to add on after the fact (many startup use Agile because it's good for an immediate product roadmap)
- Lots of moving parts in the product that are dependent on one another

#### Where Agile Falters
- Lots of meetings, can make it seem like people are more focused on showing they got work than actually getting work done
- Constant deadlines can lead to a buildup of technical debt
- Can feel like chaos sometimes if implemented poorly

Agile was once thought to be a silver-bullet for software, but there is a growing push-back that Agile isn't the one-size-fits-all solution it was originally billed to be.
