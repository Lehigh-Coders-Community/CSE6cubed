## Waterfall vs Agile

Waterfall and Agile are considered the two largest "branches" of development methodologies. Waterfall is a linear approach to project management, while Agile is designed to be an interative process. Generally, Agile is the standard in most companies nowadays, but it's still important to know why Waterfall was used and why Agile developed as a counter balance against it. 

### Waterfall

Waterfall is the "old" methodology, and was generally used in large software companies. 

Waterfall tends to work best when:
- The product doesn't change much from year to year
- Very defined product (customer needs well known)
