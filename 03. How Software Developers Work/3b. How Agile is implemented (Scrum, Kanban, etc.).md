# Agile Software Development: 
**Scrum vs Kanban**

Welcome to a very real aspect of full-fledged, professional software development: the **Agile** methodology. 

In the *Agile environment*, we can identify a couple of key players who ultimately will be the ones to facilitate success. 

1. The Product Owner defines the product backlog and directs the development team
2. The Development Team implements the aspirations of the product owner in a timeframe which allows incremental deliverables to the customer
3. The Scrum Master (SCRUM) / Agile Coach (KANBAN) leads organizational meetings for the development team and product owner, creates a schedule and helps work through the backlog of desirable objectives
4. The Customer provides continuous feedback to the aforementioned three parties

The (1) Product Owner will define the concept to be developed by (2) the Development Team. The (3) Scrum Master or Agile Coach will handle the organizational aspects associated with the chosen agile method and hold all other parties accountable. The (4) Customer will continually be delivered aspects of the product incrementally, and will provide feedback to the Product Owner & Development Team based on their experiences.

Agile software development is an ecosystem of consistent creation, feedback, and compartmentalization. It also operates on a 
‘pull’ basis, which will be explained in the coming sections. 

Now that we have an idea of Agile development, we can analyze the contrast between SCRUM & KANBAN.

### Scrum

In a **scrum** environment, we delegate our work into two-week ‘*sprints*’. 

Sprints are a block of time to achieve a number of predefined objectives, chosen during the annual *sprint planning meeting*. 

The *scrum board* consists of general to-dos, build objectives, testing objectives, and finished aspects.

The **pull** system originates from the backlog, and successively moves throughout categories on the scrum board. 

- Once an item is ‘finished’, the next item to be finished is the last item in the ‘testing’ category on the scrum board.

- Once the latest ‘testing’ objective is pulled into the finished phase, the ‘testing’ category will seek to pull an objective from the ‘build’ category, and so on for ‘build’ and ‘to-do’.

The to-do section is also called the *sprint backlog*.

Incomplete items from the previous sprint backlog will be considered as priority for the next sprint.

New ideas are queued at the end of the sprint backlog.

### Kanban

**In Kanban, there are no sprints!**

It is a continuous method, and there are *no definite timelines*.

It is a “work in progress” based system, a.k.a *WIP*.

The equivalent of a *Sprint board* is a *Kanban board*, and the equivalent of a *Sprint Master* is an *Agile Coach*.

In Kanban, there are daily stand-up meetings to review objectives, frequent demos, and daily ‘retrospectives’ to review work and define expectations.

Here's a generalized explanation of the two with comparisons & contrasts:

#### Microsoft Azure DevOps - Azure Boards
This is an industry-standard technology that's used at a variety of software companies, both big and small. This uses agile methodology, among other related things in the development cycle.
