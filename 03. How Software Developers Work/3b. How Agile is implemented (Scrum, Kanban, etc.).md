## Agile

Agile is a design philosophy that focuses on rapid, iterative development which a focus on continuous value delivery. Agile is an overall family of Agile-implementations, some of which are described below. There are more methods than could be possible to list, and most real-world implementations borrow from several of these methods. These are just some good buzzwords to understand and be able to talk about in your interviews. Some common things that most Agile implementations share are described here.

### Common Agile Things
- Sprints - The "unit" of Agile, 2-3 week periods (on average) with deliverables at the end of the sprint. Plans are designed to be estimated within the context of a sprint length. You're supposed to plan for the sprint, and not be over or under-estimate progress to the best of your ability.
- Sprint Planning - Happens at the beginning of the sprint, you plan on all the work that will happen in the sprint. Big focus is about assigning people with ownership of specific tasks. Focus is to be accurate, not over or under promise (though you should build in stuff-will-go-wrong buffer). Plan in for testing and code reviews, as any big software project has that.
- Stand-ups - Daily meetings where everyone goes around and says what they worked on yesterday, what they're working on today, and just general project updates. Designed to be quick meetings to the point where you shouldn't even need to sit down.
- Sprint Review - At the end of the Sprint, the team should sit down and talk about what was accomplished, what worked for the team, and what didn't work for the team. Designed to have a focus on actions of improvement for next sprint. OFten followed by the sprint planning meeting for the next sprint.

### Agile Implementations

#### Scrum

Probably the most common implementation of Agile in today's world of development. Probably the most interesting aspect of Scrum is the team structure:
- Product Owner - Someone who serves as a liaison between the technical team and the business requirements. Generally skews more towards non-coders/business administrator, but doesn't have to. Represents and advocates for the "customer" and their needs, whoever the customer/end user of the product may be. 
- Scrum Master - Generally serves as the team lead/engineering manager. Interfaces between the team and the product owner, reminds everyone and implements scrum practices, runs meetings, and the like. Does some development, but also a lot of technical requirement gathering along with the Product Owner. Plans a lot of the sprint and assigns work along with the team.
- Scrum Team - The engineering team, team size varies between 5-20 developers, though most times it stays under 10. Designed to be a collaborative environment, no one developer should be a "superman" pulling others along. Focus on solving problems, not one-upping each other.

#### Extreme Programming (XP)

Basically a bare-bones version of Scrum, where the management structure is condensed to the point where every developer is a product owner and team member. It's called Extreme for a reason, and generally is only implemented for small, experienced teams with high-touch products with lots of required customer feedback.
