## Agile

Agile is a design philosophy that focuses on rapid, iterative development which a focus on continuous value delivery. Agile is an overall family of Agile-implementations, some of which are described below. There are more methods than could be possible to list, and most real-world implementations borrow from several of these methods. These are just some good buzzwords to understand and be able to talk about in your interviews. Some common things that most Agile implementations share are described here.

### Common Agile Things
- Sprints - The "unit" of Agile, 2-3 week periods (on average) with deliverables at the end of the sprint. Plans are designed to be estimated within the context of a sprint length. You're supposed to plan for the sprint, and not be over or under-estimate progress to the best of your ability.
- Sprint Planning - Happens at the beginning of the sprint, you plan on all the work that will happen in the sprint. Big focus is about assigning people with ownership of specific tasks. Focus is to be accurate, not over or under promise (though you should build in stuff-will-go-wrong buffer). Plan in for testing and code reviews, as any big software project has that.
- Stand-ups - Daily meetings where everyone goes around and says what they worked on yesterday, what they're working on today, and just general project updates. Designed to be quick meetings to the point where you shouldn't even need to sit down.
- Sprint Review - At the end of the Sprint, the team should sit down and talk about what was accomplished, what worked for the team, and what didn't work for the team. Designed to have a focus on actions of improvement for next sprint. OFten followed by the sprint planning meeting for the next sprint.
