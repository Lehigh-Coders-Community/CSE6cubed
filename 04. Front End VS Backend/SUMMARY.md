## Front End & Backend

This is fundemental concept - one that is critical to making anything with software. So here's the distinction in one sentence: Front-end code is technology us (people) interact with; back-end code is technology databases interact with. Connecting them together allows people to create & share data (our goals as programmers is to do this in a way that is good & useful).

We are interacting with technology in new ways - which means new front-ends. People started interacting with technology through websites and apps, but with the popularity of voice assistants, and AR/VR - this is certainly all going to evolve. Unfortunatly, I can't promise you that what this course will cover won't be out of date in 10 years. Here is what I can promise you - the questions we need to ask when making a front-end (How are we going to structure this? How should we make this look? How would making this more dynamic make this more helpful? How are other people solving this problem?) - won't be outdated.

In this course, we are going to answer these questions in the context of a webiste. Right now, that has a lot of real world applications & it's easiest for hands on code-labs. In a later chapter, we cover application development.

We are also collecting a lot more data - and doing way more with it each year. I hate to be all ["look at this graph"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIlNIVXpIns) with you, but - look at this graph!

![In as early as 2025 humankind may have produced more than 160 zettabytes of data cumulatively.](https://icdn1.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/dna-data-catalog-stats-4-2956x1663.png)

We hope to answer the basic questions around this. How do we get this data - using the internet? How do we manage that data? How do we use other developers' data (with their permission of course)? What are the best practices for keeping this all organized? Questions like "how do we then feed this data to a machine learning model?" and "what if we want to store this data on a blockchain?" are out of scope for this course. However, there are great contributors and professors you should reach out to with those questions!

We are going to answer these questions in this chapter in the context of a back-end for a standard website. But again - the concepts that we are talking about have been around for decades.
