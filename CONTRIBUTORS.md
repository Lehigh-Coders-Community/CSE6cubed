Description: I just graduated from Lehigh with a degree in computer science and biology. Currently I am pursuing a Masters in computer science (at Lehigh) with the intention of trying to learn how to combine biology and computer science effectively in bioinformatics.

Working On: I am doing research with Dr. He to use machine learning algorithms to predict which bacteriophages can best infect a given bacterial host. Additionally, I am mostly done working on a website for LUEMS that will allow its members to easily schedule shifts as well as other administrative tasks (that is, it has core functionality complete but I still want to add some additional things.)

Description: I surround myself with people who are smarter than me to learn from them. I'm motivated and determined to always better myself, and I bring out the best in others because I know that brings out the best in me. I'm driven to learn and persistently curious about business, computer science, and data analysis. I love applying the theory of computer science, math, and statistics to real-world business applications.
