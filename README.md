# Welcome to CSE006 ^3 ðŸ‘‹ 

There are many different paths you can take with a computer science degree. Some people specialize in a field of computer science (data science, machine learning, etc.). Many choose to take a role without programming that uses the problem-solving skills they developed. However, it is fair to say that the most common paths for CS graduates are software engineering and development roles.

We want to make sure that every student graduating from Lehigh with a CS degree was prepared for software engineering roles after Lehigh. If you want updates as we work on this, make sure to watch this repository (I recommend the "releases only" option). If you would like to join in contributing to this project - email jac221@lehigh.edu.

Sincerely,
The CSE006^3 Contributors
