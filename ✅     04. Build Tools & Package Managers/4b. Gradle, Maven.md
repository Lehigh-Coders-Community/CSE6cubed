## Gradle
Gradle is a build-automation tool. What does that mean? That means Gradle can be configured to run complicated tasks with a simple command. For example, we could have a task that compiles all of our code. We could have another task that runs unit tests. We could have another task that creates documentation files based on code blocks in the source code. In order to see all the tasks that we can run with gradle, we can run "gradle tasks".

All of this is to say that, despite what you may have heard, Gradle does its best to actually make your life easier.

Very often, a gradle project is used to manage Java code and to do that, we apply a plugin in the build.gradle file as such:

```
apply plugin: 'java'
```
Running the above lets us run a command "gradle build" which will compile, test, and assemble our Java code into a JAR file for us!

Gradle is also very effective for importing software packages. In short, we can tell a project what code repositories our code depends on and gradle will make sure to fetch them for us. For an example of this, visit the Declare Dependencies section of [this] (https://spring.io/guides/gs/gradle/) article.

## Maven

Maven is very similar in concept to gradle (in fact, gradle uses tools made available by maven!) Instead of using a gradle.build file though, it uses something called a pom.xml file. POM is project object model. As you may have guessed, the pom.xml file utilizes xml styling to indicate to maven what is what.
