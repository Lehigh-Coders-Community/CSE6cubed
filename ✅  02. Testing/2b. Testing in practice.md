# What does testing look like in practice?

For whatever code you'll need to test - you'll probably just google "x programming language unit testing". Here are some examples to get you started, but whatever framework you pick will have better documentation / use cases.

The most important thing is to cut down all of those System.out.print(), print(), console() statements and pick one.

### JavaScript

Jest is a great testing framework for JavaScript: https://jestjs.io/

Here's an example:

```js
function sumJavaScript(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// see how we use 'expect' in this context?
// Instead of toBe we can use more forgiving assertions that handle floating point errors
test("adds 1 + 2 to equal 3", () => {
  expect(sumJavaScript(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

### Python

The pytest framework is great for python: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/

```python
def sum_python(a, b):
    return a + b

# assert here is the alternative to 'expect'
# Other librarites such as numpy can be used for functionality like isClose() in python
# ... as always with Python - there is a library for that
def test_answer():
    assert sum_python(2, 3) == 5
```

When you can't find the perfect debugger tool for your situation, just remember that you are only human: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJ5vpTqV/
