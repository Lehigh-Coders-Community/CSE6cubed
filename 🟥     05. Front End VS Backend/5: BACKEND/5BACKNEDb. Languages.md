## Backend Refresher
What is a backend? Well, you probably understand by now that the frontend code repository is reponsibile for how a user will see view a website or app whereas the backend code repository is responsible for what a user will see and getting all that information to the frontend so it can display it! Essentially, the backend is responsible for being able take requests for data, fetch and return that data, and make modifications to stored data.
