# Types of Software Design Patterns

There are four main types of Software Design Patterns and are categorized based on the kinds of problems they intend to solve:

### [Creational Patterns](./7c.%20Creational%20Patterns.md)
These design patterns are concerned with **dynamic Object-creation mechanisms.**

Focus on two areas: 

1. Encapsulate knowledge about which concrete class the system uses given the dynamic situation presented to the piece of software

2. Hide how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined

Most popular forms of the Creational Software Design Pattern include:
- [Abstract Factory Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern)
- [Builder Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern)
- [Factory Method PAttern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern)
- [Singleton Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)

### [Structural Patterns](./7d.%20Structural%20Patterns.md)
These design patterns are about **identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities.**

Most popular forms of the Structural Software Design Pattern include:
- [Adaptor/Wrapper/Translator Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern)
- [Bridge Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern)
- [Composite Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern)
- [Decorator Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern)
- [Facade Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern)

### [Behavioral Patterns](./7e.%20Behavioral%20Patterns.md)
These design patterns are all about **identifying common communication patterns among objects, increasing flexibility in carrying out said communication.**

Most popular forms of the Behavioral Software Design Pattern include:
- [Iterator Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern)
- [Observer Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)
- [Publisher/Subscriber Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe)
- [Strategy Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern)
- [Template Method Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern)

### [Concurrency Patterns](./7f.%20Concurrency%20Patterns.md)
These design patterns are less common than the previously described types, however, they are certainly gaining in popularity with the increased complexity and multi-cored nature of many devices.

Concurrency patterns are concerned with the **design of multi-threaded systems.**

Most popular forms of the Concurrency Software Design Pattern include:
- [Active Object Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_object)
- [Double-checked Locking Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_checked_locking_pattern)
- [Monitor Object Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization))
- [Reactor Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern)
- [Thread-specific Storage Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-Specific_Storage)


## Other Areas of Research
While these are the four main categories for generalized software development, there has been ongoing efforts to develop Design Patterns in specific domains to provide the same benefits in more granular applications. Some of these include:
- User Interface Design
- Information Visualization
- Security/Secure Usability
- Business Model
