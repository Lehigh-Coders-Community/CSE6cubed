# Behavioral Software Design Patterns

## Iterator Design Pattern:
This design pattern is very useful because it **provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying data structures/representation.**

This allows for algorithms to be independent of the container-type they are traversing since the Iterator implements the logic to provide sequential elements.

Below is the UML Diagram for this pattern:

## Observer Design Pattern:
This pattern is mainly used to implement a form of **distributed event handling system in an "event driven" application.** One object acts as the subject, which maintains a list of "observers", and notifies all observers of any state changes.

Below is the UML Diagram for this pattern:

An example implementation in Java of the Observer Pattern can be [found here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern#Java)
